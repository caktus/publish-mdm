Publish MDM
===========

Publish MDM is a proof-of-concept open-source tool to publish XLSForm templates
from Google Sheets to `ODK Central <https://getodk.org/>`_. It offers support
for single sign-on with Google, project template variables, and a user-friendly
interface for publishing form versions.

Tutorial
========

This guide will walk you through publishing a form to ODK Central using ODK
Publish.


1. Setup ODK Central
--------------

Create or access an existing ODK Central instance. You can use `ODK Cloud`_, a
:doc:`local Docker-based instance <local-development/odk-central>`, or your own
deployment.

1. Create an admin user for Publish MDM to use. This user will be used to
   publish forms to ODK Central.

2. Create a project for the forms you will be publishing.

2. Setup Publish MDM
--------------------

Follow the :doc:`Quickstart with Docker <docker-compose>` or :doc:`Local
Development <local-development/index>` guide to run Publish MDM locally.

1. Configure Publish MDM environment variables. You will need to set the
   following environment variables:

   - ``GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`` and ``GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET``: These are the OAuth
     credentials for the Google account you will use to authenticate with ODK
     Central and to download forms from Google Sheets.

   - ``GOOGLE_API_KEY`` and ``GOOGLE_APP_ID`` are used to enable the `Google Picker <https://developers.google.com/drive/picker/guides/overview>`_,
     which users will use to give access to specific spreadsheets in their Google accounts.
     To get the API key, `create it in your Google Cloud dashboard <https://developers.google.com/drive/picker/guides/overview#setup>`_.
     The ``GOOGLE_APP_ID`` is the "Project number" in the `Google Cloud dashboard <https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard>`_.

   - ``INFISICAL_API_URL``, ``INFISICAL_TOKEN``, and ``INFISICAL_KMS_PROJECT_ID``: See :doc:`infisical`.

2. Start the Publish MDM server, login with your Google account, and make
   yourself an admin.

3. Create a Central Server using your ODK Central server's base URL and credentials.
You can do this in Admin (``/admin/publish_mdm/centralserver/``) or on the frontend.

If you're using the local Docker-based ODK Central instance, you can set the base
URL to ``http://central-dev.localhost:9100``.
Additionally, you may need to add ``central-dev.localhost`` to your
``/etc/hosts`` so Python can resolve the lookback address.

4. Sync your ODK Central project by visiting
   http://localhost:8000/odk/servers/sync/.


3. Setup project in Publish MDM
-------------------------------

Now that you have ODK Central and Publish MDM set up, you can add form templates
to Publish MDM.

1. **Define variables:** If your forms use template variables, you will need to `add template
   variables`_ and then associate them with the `project in the admin`_.

2. **Add forms:** Use `Add a form template`_ in the Django admin to add each project form to
   Publish MDM. You will need to provide the form's title, form ID base, and the
   form's Google Sheet URL.

3. **Create app users with variables:** `Export App Users`_  and fill in app
   user details, variable values, and assign them to forms. Then `Import App
   Users`_  using the exported file to create or update app users in Publish MDM.

4. **Generate ODK Collect QR codes:** Generate QR codes by clicking
   Actions->Regenerate QR Codes on the `App Users`_ page.

5. **Publish forms:** Publish the forms to ODK Central by clicking Publish on a
   form detail page.
